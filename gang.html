    	 		 <h2 style="color:white">Dutch</h2>
    	 		 <p style="color:white">Dutch himself is shown to be a merciless killer who justifies killing innocent people or lawmen as a way of combating the corruption of the federal government. Despite his brutal ways, Dutch is educated and, unlike many outlaws, genuinely believes he is committing these crimes for idealistic reasons rather than greed. His anti-government and pro-individualist idealism, combined with his natural charisma, attracted a following of people who had been downtrodden by the society they lived in. Several members of the gang were orphans, minorities, town drunks, former prostitutes and other lowlifes; people who had felt they had no purpose until they joined the gang and Dutch gave them one. This created a strong sense of unity within the gang and a great sense loyalty to Dutch.</p>

    		<section id="section2">
    	 		 <h2 style="color:white">Hosea</h2>
    	 		 <p style="color:white">Hosea is an intelligent outlaw in touch with his wits, having worked as a con-artist and a thief for over two decades. He appears to be a slick talker, using his brains to get into and out of any situation in hand. Unlike Arthur or Dutch, Hosea prefers not to use violence as a means of obtaining money. Instead, Hosea often resorts on elaborate schemes to swindle people out of their money, playing a character to distract and disarm those he is trying to rob.</p>
				 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/d/d1/Hosea_injured.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210625011427" height=280px width=auto alt="Hosea">
    		</section>
    		<section id="section3">
    	  		<h2 style="color:white">Arthur</h2>
    	  		<p style="color:white">Despite his ability to commit great acts of violence Arthur has his own moral code and doesn't believe in what he deems as unnecessary killing, especially if it endangers himself or those he cares about. Dutch also raised Arthur to believe that revenge is a fruitless endeavor. It seems that Arthur strictly believes that violence should be cold, necessary and without feeling, never out of personal enjoyment or without reason.</p>

    	 	<section id="section4">
    	  		<h2 style="color:white">John</h2>
    	  		<p style="color:white">In Red Dead Redemption 2, a younger John Marston is depicted. Unlike his older self, John is seen as having a more apathetic, colder personality towards his family. He avoids his responsibly of being a father to Jack, even believing for a time that Jack wasn't his son and often expressing annoyance at Abigail when she chastises him for this. At one point, John even jokes about his family "seeing corpses" in reference to all the people he's killed, showing that he has no moral qualms around his family. As the Van der Linde gang faces increasingly dire situations, John frequently questions Dutch's plans and the overall morality of the gang. At the same time, John realizes how much of a poor husband and father he's been, due to the growing danger his family are being put in due to his actions, which ultimately causes him to change after his wife and son leave him in 1907.</p>

    		<section id="section5">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Abigail</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Abigail is shown to be a motherly and protective woman. She's strong-willed, independent, and loves her family dearly and can be quite strict at times. She often finds herself at odds with John, disliking her husband's habits of endangering himself and the family in the name of revenge and redemption, not wanting to become a widow and more importantly, leaving their son fatherless.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/d/d1/Agibail_Marston_RDR2.png/revision/latest?cb=20211029161914" height=280px width=auto alt="Abigail">
   			</section>
    		<section id="section6">
    	  		<h2 style="color:white">Jack</h2>
    	  		<p style="color:white">Born into a gang of criminals, Jack's upbringing was that the gang was family to him and he called most of them his aunts and uncles. A comment from Jack himself in 1907 suggests the gang not only cared about him a lot and tried to keep him out of their illegal activities, but also avoided mentioning them to the boy, yet Jack still managed to deduce something about it by himself.</p>

    		<section id="section7">
    	  		<h2 style="color:white">Molly</h2>
    	  		<p style="color:white">Molly is considered stuck-up and entitled by the other women in camp, especially Karen, which is mainly due to her disdain for others and her refusal to do any work inside or outside of camp. Molly has made a point of saying she's not interested in chores or what she perceives as lowly work; When Arthur asks if she'd like to join the other girls in cleaning around the camp, she responds with "I'm nobody's servant girl, Mr. Morgan."<br>Molly's mental state declines throughout the game, seemingly due to a combination of Dutch's neglect, the indifference of the other gang members, and the fear of the encroaching law enforcement. As such she becomes increasingly unwilling to socialize with others, often saying: "I need to be alone" or "I'm not much company" to Arthur if he tries to converse with her. Arthur will say on some occasions that he thinks Molly is "losing it". After Kieran and Sean both die, she becomes visibly hysterical and asks Arthur "How is any of this okay?"</p>

   			</section>  
			<section id="section8">
    	 		 <h2 style="color:white">Susan</h2>
    	 		 <p style="color:white">Ms. Grimshaw is heavily depicted as a forthright, "strict maternal figure" towards the Van der Linde gang. She admitted to Arthur that some people need a firmer hand than others, whist adding that someone has to keep the rabble in line, otherwise they would "rot in their own filth".<br>Despite having a tough love attitude towards the gang's members, she does care about them and secretly holds sympathy and even deep affection towards most of them, which on occasion (though rarely) she will express.</p>
    	 		 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/4/4e/Grimshaw1899.png/revision/latest?cb=20201015033330" height=280px width=auto alt="Susan">
    		</section>
    		<section id="section9">
   		  		 <h2 style="color:white">Pearson</h2>
    	 		 <p style="color:white">Pearson is described as a loud and jolly degenerate, who appears to be in denial about the turn his life has taken. He takes his position as the camp’s cook seriously, and is always grateful when Arthur offers to go out hunting. Pearson is quite fond of his time spent in the Navy, and spends most of his time nostalgically reminiscing about his experiences at sea. He is one of the most peaceful members of the gang, as he doesn't actively participate in any criminal activities and settles down to an honest life after the gang's downfall.</p>
    	 		 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/f/f9/PearsonRDR2.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20190330182321" height=280px width=auto alt="Pearson">
    		</section>
    		<section id="section10">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Micah</h2>
	      		<p style="color:white">Micah is considered to be wild and unpredictable, even by the Van der Linde gang's standards. He is said to enjoy the action in his life, going as far as shooting what Arthur claims to be half the town of Strawberry in order to reclaim his prized revolvers. In spite of his brash nature, Micah is an experienced criminal and hitman, earning him the favor of Dutch himself. Micah has a poor relationship with most of the gang members, as he frequently antagonizes and bullies them, sometimes going as far as making colourful threats to those he dislikes.</p>

   			</section>
     		<section id="section11">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Charles</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Arguably the most honorable member of the gang, Charles is cool-headed and reluctant to kill; the continuing blood spilled by the gang is ultimately what causes him to become disillusioned with it and helping the Wapiti Indians instead. He disapproves of people who are nothing but vicious killers, such as his notable disdain for the Callander brothers and Micah. He is also compassionate towards wild animals and shows rare visible anger when encountering the poachers' killing bison for sport. He despises racism, throwing Micah to the ground instantly for calling him a redskin, and being visibly impressed by Dutch's fair treatment of all races.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/a/a3/Charles_1907.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20200915061447" height=280px width=auto alt="Charles">
   			</section>
    		<section id="section12">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Bill</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">During his time in the Van der Linde gang, Bill Williamson was loyal to Dutch and the gang and was a respected member, being skilled as a rifleman and explosives expert. Because Dutch gave him purpose, Bill is loyal to him to a fault, and staunchly supports Dutch's every decision, even after Dutch starts going insane. Bill's loyalty to Dutch is implied to be at least partially motivated by fear; not of Dutch himself, but of what the future holds for him should he end up alone again. He is also shown to be driven by the desire to prove himself, though he often falls short because of his recklessness and lack of intelligence.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/e/ee/Bill1899.png/revision/latest?cb=20200927154900" height=280px width=auto alt="Bill">
   			</section>
    		<section id="section13">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Strauss</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Strauss was noted to be a serious and unemotional man, which allowed him to be effective in his job as the main operator behind the Van der Linde gang's loan sharking business. After the events of Chapter 4, however, Leopold expresses more and more anxiety and fear for everyone's safety. Sadie notes he was a ball of nerves due to the aftermath of the Saint Denis bank robbery and during the absence of Dutch and the others while they were on Guarma. In Beaver Hollow, Leopold also expresses severe concern to Susan Grimshaw, stuttering all the while. This was because he was extremely devoted to the gang, refusing to give up any of his friends to the Pinkertons despite being expelled from the gang and being under torture. Strauss' eventual death in custody ultimately meant that he sacrificed himself for the gang, thus achieving his own redemption in the process.</p>

    		<section id="section14">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Karen</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Karen grew to love and enjoy the outlaw life she led. She is described as a bold woman and takes pleasure in drinking with her fellow outlaws. A consummate actress, Karen often employed her dramatic skills in various robberies and scams with the gang. She is notably the only female character other than Sadie to perform guard duty for the camp. Like most of the other women in the gang, Karen does have a soft spot for young Jack Marston, which is shown when he is safely returned from Angelo Bronte.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/1/16/RDR2_Karen_Jones.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190102070443" height=280px width=auto alt="Karen">

    	 		 <h2 style="color:white">Javier</h2>
    	 		 <p style="color:white">A revolutionary, Escuella was a firm idealist who held loyalty above any other virtue and could passionately devote his life to a cause. This allowed him to connect with Dutch, who Javier remained unwaveringly loyal to throughout the time they knew each other. As of 1899, Javier is seen to be friendly with most gang members and possesses a strong sense of camaraderie. He seems to be good friends with John Marston, gladly volunteering to search for him when he goes missing during a snowstorm, although the two drift apart later on when John begins to lose faith in Dutch. His closest friendship seems to be with Bill, however, with the two having similar views on Dutch. Additionally, Javier will be the one who tries to rescue Bill if he is captured by bounty hunters, Bill was asked specifically to care for Javier on Guarma, Bill felt he could console Javier in who the “rat” is, and the duo also appear to run off together after the standoff. By 1911, the two still seem to be friends, as Javier helps Bill to escape America and flee to Mexico.</p>

    		<section id="section16">
     			 <h2 style="color:white">Tilly</h2>
     			 <p style="color:white">Tilly is often considered sweet and innocent by her peers and is well-liked. She appears to like Molly O'Shea more than some of the other women, as evident in the mission "Polite Society, Valentine Style" when she is the first to express regret in not bringing Molly along. However, after Molly was killed after confessing to betraying the gang, Tilly is less sympathetic than most of the other women and believes that O'Shea got what she deserved. Jackson is also shown to be brave and altruistic, saving Jack from the Pinkertons in the absence of other gang members.</p>

      			<h2 style="color:white">Uncle</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Uncle is a reformed petty thief with a notable love for alcohol. He is notoriously lazy, both in the Van der Linde gang and while working on the Marston ranch, and often says that his supposed medical condition of "terminal lumbago" stops him from being able to work. Despite contributing occasionally to everyday tasks, Uncle is frequently belittled for being useless and inept, much to his chagrin. In his own way, Uncle can be viewed as seeking redemption from his life of petty crime by working at Beecher's Hope, and later losing his life to keep the Marston family safe.</p>

      			<h2 style="color:white">Mary-Beth</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Mary-Beth presents herself as a kind and good-natured woman, and while this is certainly true she is also a competent thief and scam artist. Within the gang she is genuinely loving and considers most of them family. Mary-Beth is a devout bookworm, almost always seen reading a romance novel at camp, and even becomes a writer herself in the epilogue, albeit a very self-deprecating one. She's insecure about her passion and always gets shy and bashful whenever someone asks about it, calling her own books "silly".</p>

   	   			<h2 style="color:white">Lenny</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Lenny is shown to be an intelligent, fun-loving young man. He is also shown to be very competent and effective in many situations, with Hosea and Arthur particularly viewing him as one of the gang's best men. Like most members, he is very loyal to the Van der Linde gang and considers them family. Out of everyone at camp, he appears to be the most educated; this is likely due to his upbringing which, when compared to others in the gang, was more reasonably decent.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/8/8e/Lenny_Summers_rdr2.png/revision/latest?cb=20181119072325" height=280px width=auto alt="lenny">

    		<section id="section20">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Trelawny</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">A man with a cunning character, Trelawny is willing to do whatever it takes to save himself. Despite considering the Van der Linde gang to be friends, he is always looking out for himself, and his interests. He fashions himself as a flamboyant and sharp-tongued gentleman who is cordial towards just about everybody but isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. He's also capable of incredible magic tricks.</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/c/c6/Ajmrdrtrewlawny.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20181104011433" height=280px width=auto alt="Trelawny">

    		<section id="section21">
      			<h2 style="color:white">Swanson</h2>
      			<p style="color:white">Swanson is a broken and disheveled priest, often drunk. He is also a drug addict, as Arthur can find the Reverend’s supposed bible hiding a syringe, a tourniquet, and a bottle of morphine.<br>Later in the story, he eventually sobers up and becomes more responsible. This is best seen in how, when the gang began to implode, he was one of the first to sense its impending doom and leave, claiming to be a "changed man". Swanson also possessed a certain degree of astuteness and was able to see through Dutch's true nature, claiming that he won't die for "nonsense spouted by a fool".</p>
      			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/9/9e/Ajmrdrrevswanson.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20181028033801" height=280px width=auto alt="Swanson">

     			 <h2 style="color:white">Sean</h2>
     			 <p style="color:white">MacGuire is said to be a cheerful man who enjoys spending his time telling stories at the gang's campfires, particularly about his family history. He loves being a part of the action, but he is relatively inexperienced and often overestimates his own abilities. At Clemens Point, he playfully tries to poke fun at Arthur, calling him 'English' and 'King Arthur'. He is perhaps the most talkative member of the gang, as Charles remarks that he speaks incessantly, and Arthur is mildly aggravated by his constant teasing at times. However, he is also somewhat lazy, literally falling asleep during guard duty multiple times, drawing the ire of Hosea.</p>
     			 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/0/09/Sean.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20200927155801" height=280px width=auto alt="Sean">

     			 <h2 style="color:white">Sadie</h2>
     			 <p style="color:white">Sadie was happily married to her husband, Jake Adler, and expresses that she was content in the life they lived together. His death made her deeply vengeful, vindictive, and consumed by desire for revenge against the O'Driscolls. Sadie also repeatedly demonstrates cruelty, a lack of care for her allies and recklessness which rivals that of Micah's - she is not above putting herself and her friends in unnecessary danger, which is exemplified in the battle against the O'Driscolls in Shady Belle where she does not co-operate with the rest of the gang, forcing Arthur to leave the house and risk getting killed, and murdering the O'Driscoll hostages at Colm's execution, starting a firefight.</p>
     			 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/2/2b/Sadie.png/revision/latest?cb=20200927011426" height=280px width=auto alt="Sadie">

    	  		<h2 style="color:white">Kieran</h2>
    	  		<p style="color:white">Kieran is described by Arthur as a "gentle buffoon". This is shown best during "Old Friends", as he is being chased by Arthur, he doesn't open fire on him despite this, and upon falling off his horse, he still doesn't, and simply surrenders, saying "Don't hurt me, please!".<br>Although the gang kidnapped him, he seems intent on earning their trust and becoming a fully-fledged member. He tells Arthur that he plans on proving himself to him. When Jack is kidnapped, he tells Abigail that he would give his life for Jack if he could. He becomes genuinely frustrated whenever someone refers to him as an "O'Driscoll", and zealously told Dutch upon meeting him that he hates Colm O'Driscoll.</p>
